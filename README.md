# PopularMoviesAppII
Android Developer NanoDegree Project

Here is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch for the Android Developer Nanodegree program.

With the app, you can:

   * Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
   * Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
   * Watch trailers
   * Read reviews

# How to Work with the Source

This app uses The Movie Database API to retrieve movies. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to: app/build.gradle
